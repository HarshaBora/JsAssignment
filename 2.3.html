        <h1>MY day2 3rd JS Assignment</h1>
        <p>
            In Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data.
            The five most basic types of data are strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null.
            We refer to these as primitive data types. A single variable can only store a single type of data.
        </p>
        <h5><b>booleans </b</h5>
        <p>Booleans can only have two values. True and false. They represent all data that only has two states, like a light switch. On or off.</p><br>
        <h5>strings</h5>
        <p>A string is a collection of alphanumeric characters. I start a string by typing double quotes, single quotes, or the backtick character. Double quote and single quote behave identically, and the backtick character comes with some extra functionality.</p><br>
        <h5>Numbers</h5>
        <p> Numbers are as straightforward as they sound. Numbers are for numbers. I can’t put a letter on here. I can make this number be as long as I want it. I cannot add a comma, but I can add a decimal point. So numbers are any integer or decimal number created in the language, and they’re used for money, age, etc.</p>
